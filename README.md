# Project Name

In this project I have built a chatbot for ordering food in javascript. The goal of the project was to learn how to use variables, conditional statements and functions.


## The problem

I planned my bot by writing down to questions the bot will ask and also in what way the user could answer. To find answers to my questions I used Technigos material on the subject and also google, youtube and stackoverflow.

If I had more time I would add more questions to my bot.
